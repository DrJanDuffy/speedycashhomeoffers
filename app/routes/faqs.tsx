              </h3>
              <p className="text-gray-600">
                Yes, we do purchase manufactured and mobile homes, but you must own the land as well. This is because manufactured homes 
                without land ownership can present unique challenges in the buying and selling process. If you own both the home and the land, 
                we can provide you with a fair cash offer for your manufactured home property in Las Vegas or Southern California.

              </h3>
              <p className="text-gray-600">
                Yes, although the seller is responsible for any commission owed to the Realtor. Any formal offer will need to be submitted 
                through your current realtor as long as you are in contract. We understand that sometimes homeowners change their minds about 
                the traditional selling process, and we're happy to work within your existing arrangements to provide you with a cash offer option.

                The timeline is completely up to you. We can typically close within 10-14 days if you need a quick sale, or we can extend 
                the closing date to 60 days or longer if you need more time to prepare for your move. Our flexible approach allows you to 
                choose a closing date that works best for your personal situation and timeline.

              Our experienced team is here to help answer any questions you may have about selling your home. 
              We understand that selling your house is a big decision, and we want to make sure you have all the information you need 
              to make the best choice for your situation. Whether you're facing foreclosure, dealing with an inherited property, going through 
              a divorce, or simply want to avoid the traditional selling process, we're here to provide guidance and support.
